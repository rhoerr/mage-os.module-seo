# Canonical URLs

The module manages canonical `<link rel="canonical">` tags to ensure search engines index the correct URL for each page and avoid duplicate content penalties.

## Why this module manages canonicals

Magento adds a canonical tag automatically for product and category pages. However, when a product variant URL is active (via a product variant URL module), the correct canonical is the variant URL — not the base product URL. Magento's default canonical and the variant canonical would both be present in the `<head>`, which is invalid.

`CanonicalUrlManager::setCanonical()` solves this by:

1. Removing every existing canonical link asset (matched by asset content type `canonical`,
   never by URL pattern — the asset collection also holds all CSS/JS/image assets).
2. Adding the correct canonical URL.

This service is the single authoritative place for canonical manipulation across all MageOS SEO module components. Nothing inside MageOS_Seo itself calls it — it is a bridge API for sibling modules (e.g. product-variant URL modules).

## Where canonicals are set

| Page type | Who sets the canonical | URL used |
|---|---|---|
| Product page (no variant) | Magento core (`catalog/seo/product_canonical_tag`) | Product URL |
| Product page (variant active) | Bridge module via `CanonicalUrlManager` | Variant-specific URL |
| Category page | Magento core (`catalog/seo/category_canonical_tag`) | Category URL |
| Home page | `Block\Canonical` (fallback) | Store base URL |
| CMS page | `Block\Canonical` (fallback) | Store base URL + page identifier |

The fallback block only renders on the home page and `cms_page_view`, and only when no other
canonical asset is already present (detected by asset content type). It deliberately stays off
search, cart, checkout and account pages — canonicalising those URLs would legitimise duplicate
URLs instead of consolidating them — and never derives URLs from the request Host header.

Core's product/category canonical tags are **disabled by default** in Magento; enable them under
**Stores → Configuration → Catalog → Catalog → Search Engine Optimization** if you want catalog
canonicals and no bridge module manages them.

## How it works in code

`CanonicalUrlManager` is a simple service with one public method:

```php
$canonicalManager->setCanonical(
    $canonicalUrl,   // the URL to use as canonical
    $pageConfig      // Magento\Framework\View\Page\Config
);
```

The manager removes every asset in the page asset collection whose content type is `canonical`
(this is how both core and this module register canonical link assets), then adds the new one.
The legacy third `$urlKey` parameter is retained for backward compatibility but ignored.

---

## Duplicate canonical prevention

Without this logic, a variant product page could contain two canonical tags:

```html
<!-- Added by Magento core -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/blue-t-shirt.html"/>
<!-- Added by the SEO module -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/blue-t-shirt/blue.html"/>
```

With the manager, the first one is removed before the second is added, so only one canonical is ever present.

---

## CMS pages

Magento core does not emit canonicals for CMS pages, so `Block\Canonical` covers them: it
resolves the current page via `CmsPageResolver` and builds the canonical from the store base URL
plus the page identifier (the home page canonicalises to the bare base URL). This does not
interact with `CanonicalUrlManager`.

---

## Multi-store canonicals

Canonical URLs are always absolute. The product and category URL methods return store-aware absolute URLs, so canonicals are correct for each store view without any extra configuration.

For stores sharing a product catalogue (e.g. the same product visible on two store views), Magento's built-in canonical handling applies — each store view's canonical points to that store view's URL. If cross-store-view canonical consolidation is needed, that requires hreflang and alternate link management, which is out of scope for this module.
